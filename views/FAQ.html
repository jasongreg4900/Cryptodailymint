      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Is my deposit safe?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. CryptoDailyMint uses a multi-layer security framework that prioritizes deposit protection. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Treasury-Managed Wallets:</strong> Assets are held in secure, institution-level wallets with strict access control.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold Storage Systems:</strong> A large portion of funds remain offline to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Risk Monitoring:</strong> Real-time threat detection ensures immediate response to suspicious activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal Safeguard Pools:</strong> Stability pools help protect user balances during market fluctuations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Funds are never placed into speculative or extremely volatile instruments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How fast are withdrawals?</h3>
      <p>
        Withdrawals are processed through our automated smart verification gateway. Typical processing includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Instant System Handling:</strong> Requests are automatically processed within seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification Layer:</strong> Security filters ensure the request is safe and consistent with account behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Speed:</strong> Final arrival depends on blockchain confirmation times, which can vary.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most users receive their funds within minutes after verification.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I have multiple accounts?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Each person is allowed only one account to maintain system integrity, prevent abuse, and ensure fairness for all users. 
        Multiple accounts can disrupt reward balance and trigger automated fraud detection alerts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Duplicate accounts are automatically flagged and may be restricted or removed for security purposes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do referrals earn forever?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. CryptoDailyMint offers a lifetime referral program. This means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Permanent Rewards:</strong> You receive commissions for each deposit made by your referred users indefinitely.</li>
        <li><strong>10% Commission Level:</strong> A fixed percentage is credited automatically after each deposit cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Passive Earnings:</strong> You receive rewards even if you are not actively using your account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The referral system is designed to reward long-term community growth.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Is KYC required?</h3>
      <p>
        In most cases, no. CryptoDailyMint allows users to join and participate without mandatory identity checks. However:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Security-Triggered KYC:</strong> Suspicious behaviors or unusual account activities may require verification.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdrawal Integrity:</strong> Large or high-risk withdrawals may prompt identity confirmation.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance Situations:</strong> If regulatory requirements arise, KYC may be temporarily requested.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Basic usage does not require KYC unless automated systems detect potential risks.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What happens if I lose access to my account?</h3>
      <p>
        Users can recover access through our secure account recovery system. Verification may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Registered email confirmation</li>
        <li>Device history matching</li>
        <li>Security question validation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our support team can assist with full account restoration when necessary.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
  <h3>Are there any hidden fees?</h3>
  <p>
    No. CryptoDailyMint maintains a fully transparent financial structure. All fees are clearly displayed before you
    confirm any transaction. We do not apply stealth charges or unexpected deductions to your balance.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, depending on your activity, the following operational fees may apply:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Blockchain Network Fees:</strong> These are standard gas fees charged by the blockchain, not by CryptoDailyMint.</li>
    <li><strong>Liquidity Channel Routing Fees:</strong> When processing large transactions, routing algorithms may create minimal handling costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Plan-Specific Execution Costs:</strong> Some high-tier reward plans have clearly published service fees integrated into the earnings cycle.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Verification Fees:</strong> In rare compliance-based identity checks, external partners may include a small fee.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Every possible fee is always disclosed up front. Our system will never proceed with a transaction unless you confirm and understand the full cost.
  </p>
</div>


    <div class="faq-item">
  <h3>Can I cancel a pending withdrawal?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes — as long as your request is still in the initial verification stage. CryptoDailyMint processes withdrawals using an automated, multi-layer security protocol, which allows limited cancellation flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is how the process works:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stage 1 – Smart Verification:</strong> The system reviews device fingerprints, withdrawal patterns, and network behavior. Cancellation is available during this stage.</li>
    <li><strong>Stage 2 – Blockchain Allocation:</strong> Once the system assigns funds for blockchain dispatch, cancellation is no longer possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Stage 3 – Final Broadcast:</strong> The transfer is broadcast to the blockchain network. At this point the transaction becomes irreversible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can easily cancel a withdrawal from your dashboard if it has not yet passed Stage 1. After that point, our automated infrastructure processes the transfer without manual intervention.
  </p>
</div>


    <div class="faq-item">
  <h3>Does my account earn rewards automatically?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Once you activate a deposit plan, your account becomes part of CryptoDailyMint’s automated earning engine. No manual actions are required to receive rewards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our reward automation includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Continuous Compounding Cycles:</strong> Rewards are calculated using real-time performance metrics and added to your dashboard every cycle.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive Yield Optimization:</strong> Your active deposit plan automatically shifts between low-risk micro-yield channels to maximize stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Auto-Secure Earnings:</strong> Rewards undergo internal validation layers before being added to your balance to ensure accurate, fraud-free calculations.</li>
    <li><strong>Zero User Intervention:</strong> You don’t need to claim, reinvest, or trigger any action unless you choose to withdraw.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As long as your deposit plan remains active, your rewards will continue to grow automatically based on your plan and system performance parameters.
